How long to boil an egg:

 - 5 minutes: set white and runny yolk – just right for dipping into
 - 6 minutes: liquid yolk – a little less oozy
 - 7 minutes: almost set – deliciously sticky
 - 8 minutes: softly set – this is what you want to make Scotch eggs
 - 10 minutes: the classic hard-boiled egg – mashable but not dry and chalky
